    "# Using Gentle Forced Aligner (Built on Kaldi) for Forced Audio-Transcript Alignment \n",
    "\n",
    "_Written by Sushmita Sadhukha_\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains code to take the thought segment data (the timestamp data that mTurkers will generate by completing HITS on [Eshin Jolly's Svelte Thought Tagger app](https://github.com/cosanlab/svelte-psiturk) and _align_ the text, specifically the first and last word from each thought segment, to a larger dataframe in which _all_ words of that text has been aligned. In this large dataframe, all words of the text is aligned with a forced alignment software, which aligns _each word_ with a start and end timestamp. In this notebook, I use the [Gentle Beta Forced Aligner](https://lowerquality.com/gentle/) to generate the aligned-word timestamps.  \n",

    "#### I. What is forced alignment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Forced alignment is a method to take orthographic transcription of an audio file and generate a time-aligned version using a pronunciation dictionary (pretrained on acoustic models) to look up phones for words [(Montreal Forced Aligner, 2018)](https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#what-is-forced-alignment). Forced alignment is useful for examining the temporal dynamics of spoken text data, allowing us to generate timestamps for text and using these timestamps to perform further analyses like sentiment analysis, topic analysis, text extraction, named entity recognition, etc. \n",
